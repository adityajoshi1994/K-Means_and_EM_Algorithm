# K-Means_and_EM_Algorithm

<h2> K Means </h2>
K Means is primarily used as a clustering algorithm in which we form k clusters of the given data points. Each data point is finally associated with one of the k clusters based on its distance from the cluster centers(centroids) specified by some distance function.

The project implements this algorithm from scratch and applies it on three datasets with different k. You can find the implementation <a href="https://github.com/adityajoshi1994/K-Means_and_EM_Algorithm/blob/master/K_Means.py"> here </a>


<h2> EM Algorithm</h2>
The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a way to find maximum-likelihood estimates for model parameters when your data is incomplete, has missing data points, or has unobserved (hidden) latent variables. You can find the implementation for this algorithm <a href="https://github.com/adityajoshi1994/K-Means_and_EM_Algorithm/blob/master/EM%20algorithm.py"> here </a>
